# Data-Analytics-Project---Classification-with-Python

I created a repository for my Data Analytics Project at the University of Stirling.
This repository includes a notebook and the outcome report of my project.

All experiments for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data manipulation and visualisation, implementation of the models and their evaluation are implemented using Python programming language.

In the notebook, I predict which customers are more likely to respond positively to a bank marketing call by setting up a regular savings deposit or subscribing the term “made_deposit”. 
Three classification algorithms will be developed in order to predict the target variable. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). 
The analysis of the project includes Data Summary, Data Preparation, Modelling, Results and Errors using Evaluation Metrics, Confusion Matrices and ROC Curve.

More information about the dataset, the process I followed and the evaluation of the classification models will be found on the report.
